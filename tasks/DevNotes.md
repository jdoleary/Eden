A macOS application distributed outside the Mac App Store will generally have 3â€“4 separate layers of signing:

    The application itself will be code signed using an application certificate.
    If the application has an installer, the package file will be signed using an installer certificate.
    The disk image containing the application or installer will be signed using an application certificate.
    The disk image will notarized, and then the ticket generated by the notary service will be stapled to it.
