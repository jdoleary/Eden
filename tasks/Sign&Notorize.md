Signing an executable on macOS is typically done using Apple's code signing tools, even if it's not a complete app bundle. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to sign an executable on macOS:

    Acquire a Developer ID Certificate:
        If you havenâ€™t yet, enroll in the Apple Developer Program. This is a paid program with an annual fee.
        Once enrolled, log in to the Apple Developer Center, go to "Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles", and create a Developer ID certificate.

    Download and Install Your Developer ID Certificate:
        From the Apple Developer site, download your Developer ID certificate.
        Double-click the downloaded certificate to add it to your Keychain.

    Locate the Certificate's Common Name:
        Open the Keychain Access app on your Mac.
        Under the "My Certificates" category, locate your Developer ID certificate. Note the Common Name, which will be something like Developer ID Application: Your Name (XXXXXXXXXX).

    Sign the Executable:
        Open the Terminal.
        Use the codesign command to sign your executable:

        css

    codesign --force --verify --verbose --sign "Developer ID Application: Your Name (XXXXXXXXXX)" /path/to/your/executable

    Replace Developer ID Application: Your Name (XXXXXXXXXX) with the Common Name of your certificate (from the previous step).
    Replace /path/to/your/executable with the actual path to your executable.

Verify the Signature:

    You can verify that your executable has been successfully signed by using:

    css

        codesign --verify -vvvv /path/to/your/executable

        If the signature is valid, you should see an output indicating the executable is valid and signed by your Developer ID.

    Notarization (Optional, but Recommended):
        Starting from macOS Catalina (10.15), Apple introduced a notarization process which gives users more confidence that the software they download and run, no matter where they get it from, has been checked by Apple for malicious components.
        Notarizing involves submitting your software to Apple for a security check. If it passes, the software gets a "ticket" that can be stapled to it, ensuring users that it's been checked by Apple.
        To notarize your software, you'd generally zip it, upload it for notarization using the xcrun altool, wait for the notarization to complete, then staple the returned ticket to your software using xcrun stapler.

This process is primarily designed to build trust with end-users, ensuring that the software they're running hasn't been tampered with and doesn't contain malicious code. However, you may choose to sign without notarization, especially for internal tools or if you're distributing your software in environments where notarization isn't required.
