    - Spaced Repetition Study Extension
        - Related but not an integral part of this repository, I want to build a web extension that keeps track of the last time you viewed a page, and based on how well you say that you know the information, will invite you to revisit / study it in a "Spaced Repeition" format until you know it well.
