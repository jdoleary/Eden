Here is a `named block id` that embeds the "legend" of the Features list
Syntax: `![[Features#^f3edfd]]`
![[Features#^f3edfd]]
You can just link to a specific section, rather than embedding, with the following 
Syntax: `[[Features#^f3edfd]]`
[[Features#^f3edfd]]

You can embed an entire page like so:
`![[plain]]`
![[plain]]
